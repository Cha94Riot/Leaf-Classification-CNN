# Leaf-Classification-CNN
2019 Thesis Project creating a Convolutional Neural Network for the classification of tree leaves using Keras & TensorFlow.
The objective of the thesis was to produce a report, so the current codebase consists of diffeerent image processing and model learning scripts. The dataset is NOT error free. Hope to tidy up the codebase & improve overall model.

Run pageGUI.py to test model. Check "Show Convolution Outputs" to show the effects of each convulotion layer after the model is run.
